# NetworkView
A SwiftUI network connection and info monitor  
![Translucent Dark NetworkView window](./images/Translucent-Dark.png?raw=true? "NetworkView Window")   
Built completely with Swift and SwiftUI, this is an updated version of my [old app](https://github.com/ehemmete/NetworkInfoGUI).  
Thanks to MacTroll for helping me get the updates on network change working.

Working on making the display more flexible.  Currently you can pick monospaced font or not, the font size, and now if the window is translucent.  It does respect light/dark system choice.
