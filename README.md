![Sample NetworkView window](./NetworkView%20Window.png?raw=true "NetworkView Window")  
Built completely with Swift and SwiftUI, this is an updated version of my [old app](https://github.com/ehemmete/NetworkInfoGUI).  
Thanks to MacTroll for helping me get the updates on network change working.

Working on making the display more flexible.  Currently you can pick monospaced font or not, and the font size.  It does respect light/dark system choice.
